# Screening Resources
## Automated High-Throughput Screening Platforms

<img src="/images/20250416-tamh-tmc3houston-mb-23.jpg" alt="Automated HT Screening Platform" style="float: right; margin: 10px 0 10px 20px; width: 300px; border-radius: 6px;"/>

The 3DRC maintains and operates two major automated platforms for setting up in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assays, plus a fully integrated wash station and a suite of smaller walk-up systems for semi-automated workflows:
* **Automated Labcyte Echo 655:** A “no-touch” acoustic dispenser that uses focused sound energy to transfer compounds from source plates to assay plates in sub-microliter volumes, minimizing cross-contamination and maximizing precision. An integrated Access robotic arm handles plates between the Echo, a Thermo Cytomat 6000A automated cell-culture incubator (189-plate capacity), and a Thermo Multidrop Combi reagent dispenser, fully automating the assay-setup workflow.  
* **Biomek i7 liquid-handling platform:** Configured with a 96-channel pipetting head, an independent Span-8 arm, 100-nL pintools, and a rotating gripper, this system delivers both high precision and flexible deck access. It supports multiple plate formats and a wide range of HTS protocols—from reagent titrations to complex multi-step assays.  
* **Automated wash and reagent-addition station:** Combines a Tecan HydroSpeed microplate washer with a Thermo Orbitor plate stacker (40-plate capacity) and an integrated Thermo Multidrop Combi dispenser. This station streamlines wash cycles, reagent additions, and plate storage to keep throughput high and hands-on time low.  
* **Standalone “walk-up” and semi-automated systems:** Four Thermo Multidrop Combi dispensers and two Formulatrix Mantis liquid handlers are available for lower-throughput or user-driven assays. These bench-level platforms provide rapid turnaround for pilot screens, assay development, and follow-up experiments.  



## Automated Multi-modal Plate Reader
The DDRC has a **Synergy Neo2**, manufactured by Agilent BioTek, which is a high-performance, hybrid multi-mode microplate reader engineered for high-throughput screening (HTS) applications. This system is integrated with the BioStack Neo plate stacker, delivering fully automated, walk-away operation for a wide range of assay formats, including biochemical, cell-based, and kinetic assays. The Synergy Neo2 employs patented Hybrid Technology, combining independent filter- and quadruple monochromator-based optical paths for optimal performance across detection modes such as UV-Vis absorbance, fluorescence intensity, luminescence, fluorescence polarization, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF), TR-FRET, BRET, and AlphaScreen®/AlphaLISA®. The reader features continuously variable bandwidths (3–50 nm in 1 nm increments), up to four photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for ultra-fast measurements, and environmental controls including incubation to 70°C, CO₂/O₂ regulation, and programmable shaking, making it suitable for live-cell assays. The BioStack Neo plate stacker complements the reader by automating plate handling, with a 50-plate capacity, rapid plate exchange, and automated de-lidding features to enhance throughput and consistency, particularly for sensitive cell-based assays.

## Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
3DRC has dedicated access to a **Biacore T200** SPR biosensor. This is a high-performance system for real-time analysis of biomolecular interactions. It supports up to four flow cells in series, with paired reference subtraction to deliver precise affinity and kinetic data across a broad range of interactant sizes. It is further integrated with an autosampler to accommodate 96- or 384-well microplates, enabling unattended injection of hundreds of samples for high-throughput screening of binding kinetics, concentration determination, and specificity assays. Low-dead-volume fluidics, temperature control (4 – 40 °C), and the BioCore V4 chip ensure ultra-low noise, picomolar sensitivity, and reproducible on-/off-rate measurements; even for interactions at the extremes of the kinetic scale. The user-friendly Biacore T200 Control and Evaluation software feature guided wizards, Method Builder for custom assay design, and advanced data-analysis modules (single-cycle kinetics, heterogeneous ligand models, screening evaluation) to streamline setup, execution, and interpretation of complex 

## Isothermal Calorimetry (ITC)
3DRC also offers ITC using its **Malvern Microcal PEAQ-ITC** for direct, label-free measurement of the thermodynamic forces driving molecular interactions. ITC determines key binding parameters, including affinity (KD), stoichiometry (n), enthalpy (ΔH), and entropy (ΔS) in a single experiment, without the need for immobilization, labeling, or surface attachment. Operating under near-physiological conditions, ITC is ideal for studying protein–ligand, protein–protein, and nucleic acid interactions. Unlike SPR, which excels at kinetic profiling, ITC uniquely reveals the complete thermodynamic fingerprint of a binding event, quantifying the energetic forces that drive molecular recognition, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and conformational changes.

## Automated Flow Cytometry
For multiplex high-throughput screening of nonadherent cell-based models, the core uses an automated flow cytometry platform. The heart of the platform is a 5-laser, 30-detector **BioRad ZE5** high-throughput flow cytometer capable of running uninterrupted for up to 20 hours. The flow cytometer is integrated with an integrated robotics workstation that provides a structure to hold all equipment in a fixed orientation around an articulating **Universal Robotics 6-axis UR10** robotic plate manipulator. The platform also includes integrated peripheral devices to automate most experimental procedures needed for routine flow analysis. This equipment consists of an automated cell culture incubator, a refrigerated incubator to hold plates at 4ºC for extended periods, an on-deck automated centrifuge, a deep-well plate washer, a multi-reagent bulk liquid dispenser and plate shaker, a **Formulatrix Mantis** automated microfluidic dispenser, a microplate reading bar code scanner, and a room temperature storage and de-lidding device. All of the scheduling and integration is handled using Hudson Robotic’s Softlinx software.

## Automated High-Throughput Microscopy Platforms
The DDRC maintains and operates two automated microscope platforms from Molecular Devices for performing high-throughput microscopy (HTM) assays in vitro.

The primary platform for three-dimensional (3D) model systems is the **Molecular Devices ImageXpress Confocal HT.ai** Imaging System. This system is equipped with two selectable confocal disk geometries and internal environmental controls for humidity and carbon dioxide (CO₂), allowing for extended live-cell imaging sessions. Optimized for high-capacity screening of organoids, spheroids, and microphysiological systems (tissue chips), the HT.ai platform utilizes a 7-channel high-intensity laser light source and supports up to eight imaging channels. This enables multiplexed live-cell assays while maintaining high throughput via shortened exposure times and a water-immersion objective. The water-immersion objective enhances resolution, reduces optical aberrations, and allows for deeper imaging into 3D structures.The system is fully automated with integration of a PF400 collaborative robotic arm and a Liconic Wave cell culture incubator (37°C, 95% relative humidity, 5% CO₂). The incubator supports both live-cell imaging and fixed-cell storage at room temperature. Notably, the Wave incubator accommodates high-throughput tissue chip assays on the Mimetas microflow platform, which includes a built-in rocking mechanism to maintain continuous microfluidic flow.

In addition, the DDRC operates a second system: **ImageXpress Microconfocal**, is a high-performance confocal imaging platform with solid-state light sources. This system also features two selectable confocal disk geometries and internal environmental control. Images are acquired with 16-bit scientific CMOS (sCMOS) sensors that enable fast acquisition while preserving specimen integrity.

Both ImageXpress systems offer flexibility in balancing imaging speed and quality. Software-controlled objectives allow users to switch from low magnification (2×/0.10 NA) for ultra-high throughput—up to approximately 200,000 images/day—to high magnification (40×/0.95 NA) for high-content imaging. The software also facilitates seamless switching between confocal and wide-field imaging modes without manual reconfiguration, enabling sequential imaging of the same plate in both modes. The systems support multiplex fluorescence assays with simultaneous detection of up to five fluorophores and are compatible with Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporters. Both platforms are integrated with automated cell culture incubators, bulk liquid dispensers for reagent addition, and robotic arms for plate handling and peripheral devices.

## Automated Optical Metabolic Imaging
Changes in cellular metabolism have long been recognized as a fundamental feature, and are now considered a hallmark, of cancer. The 3DRC employs an advanced two-photon fluorescent lifetime microscopy metabolic imaging method to significantly enhance our understanding of how specific microenvironmental factors influence the regulation of cancer cell metabolism and drug responsiveness at a single-cell level. This platform utilizes a non-invasive, quantitative measure of the intrinsic fluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), a natural biomarker involved in various critical cellular processes, including mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, gene expression, oxidative stress, aging, and apoptosis. This platform also measures the autofluorescence of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that is localized in the mitochondria and is involved in the TCA cycle and complex II in the electron transport chain. The 3DRC platform is from **Intelligent Imaging Innovations (3i)** and employs femtosecond laser pulses (680-1080 nm, 140 fs, 76 MHz) generated using **Chameleon Ultra II Ti:Sapphire Laser** system (Thorlabs Inc., Newton, NJ). The laser pulses were steered toward dual-channel time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) electronics and an inverted microscope (**Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 fully motorized inverted microscope**) fitted with environmental controls for temperature, humidity, and CO2. The platform has a motorized X,Y stage with 0.1µm linear encoders to support the use of either slides or multi-well plates (96-384well/plate). This platform is equipped for both live and fixed cell widefield epifluorescence applications, transmitted illumination, and multi-photon techniques.

## Micro-electrode array
**Axion Maestro Pro** electrophysiology and impedance platform is a label-free, high-throughput multimodal bioelectronic assay system combining multi-well microelectrode array (MEA) recording (6–96 wells) and impedance-based assays (96–384 wells), with the BioCore V4 processing chip for ultra-low noise and high signal fidelity. This platform supports the majority of MLOTS standardized screening workflows, which include neurotoxicity (network activity metrics, burst and synchrony analysis) and cardiotoxicity (field potential duration, beat detection) with real-time monitoring of electrophysiological endpoints using iPSC and mouse cell models. Impedance measurements enable continuous tracking of cell proliferation, barrier function, co-culture dynamics, and long-term cell growth. These are critical dynamic endpoints for chronic toxicity and co-culture analysis assays. Integrated environmental control (heating, CO₂, humidity), barcode tracking, and AxIS software streamline assay setup, automated data acquisition, and analysis for robust throughput screening.

## TAMU-IBT Advanced Microscopy Core
Several conventional high-content imaging systems are available to 3DRC through the TAMU-IBT Advanced Microscopy Core. For high content 3-D imaging or where oil-immersion is preferred, the 3DRC uses a **Nikon W1 Yokagawa spinning disk confocal** or a **General Electric Healthcare DeltaVision Elite** deconvolution microscope. Both of these platforms feature climate-controlled (temperature, humidity, CO2) automated stages, which provide a large range of live cell capabilities. Both microscopes have multidimensional acquisition (x,y,z, wavelength, time), up to 5 channels (fluorescence and brightfield/DIC), FRET, multi-point acquisition, large area acquisition (tiling), dual Autofocus (Hardware & contrast based), fast acquisition mode and 4x,10x,20x,40x air, 40x Oil, 60x oil, 100x oil objectives.
