Our Synthetic and Medicinal Chemistry Program offers industry-standard infrastructure and capabilities to advance the discovery and optimization of novel therapeutics. Equipped with fulky equipt chemical hoods, purification systems, and characterization tools, including LC-MS and benchtop NMR, our program is poised to meet a wide range of synthetic and medicinal chemistry needs.

Our experienced team brings extensive expertise in synthetic route development, medicinal chemistry, and the synthesis of small molecules and peptides. We are uniquely positioned to incorporate innovative techniques such as phage display and non-canonical amino acid incorporation to generate unique therapeutic peptides and targeting modalities, expanding the realm of possible therapeutic solutions.

Our program also includes parallel peptide synthesis capabilities to support peptide lead optimization, allowing us to efficiently generate peptide arrays for rapid testing and refinement.

These advanced capabilities enable us to efficiently support the design, synthesis, and optimization of small molecules, peptide, and peptide-target therapeutics, working in close collaboration with our other core programs, including high-throughput screening and generative AI-driven ligand design. Together, we deliver a comprehensive and integrated approach to therapeutic discovery and development.
