Our Screening Informatics and Data Science Program is built on a flexible grid cluster architecture that enables us to develop and adapt analytical technologies as needed. This core component is focused on automating signal processing algorithms to efficiently and scalably interpret the multidimensional data produced by our High-Throughput Screening (HTS) program.

A critical aspect of our analytics program is near real-time analytics, which provide robust data tracking and quality control analysis. This ensures that data quality is maintained throughout the screening process, allowing for more reliable and actionable results.

Our program also emphasizes visualization and multi-omics data integration, which are used to summarize large volumes of data and facilitate informed decision-making. By combining diverse data types and presenting insights in a user-friendly manner, we support researchers in navigating complex datasets and driving discoveries forward.
