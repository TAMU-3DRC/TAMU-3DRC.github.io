Our High-Throughput Screening (HTS) Center is designed for maximum flexibility, offering comprehensive capabilities for the screening of small molecules, peptides, and antibodies. Our specialized features enable us to conduct radiation-based screenings, such as X-ray radiosensitizer screens, as well as co-culture screens for immunopharmacology applications.

We maintain an extensive collection of large commercial source libraries for drug repositioning, which are cost-shared and highly affordable. The detailed contents of these libraries are availableÂ [here](https://github.com/TAMU-3DRC/Libraries).

Our capabilities span a wide array of assay formats, including homogeneous protein assays, 2D and suspension cell assays, matrix-embedded organoids and spheroids, and tissue chips. Our advanced liquid handling platforms support precise generation of assay-ready plates (96 amd 384), using a range of dispensing methods such as tip, peristaltic, pin, and acoustic methods for optimal flexibility.

We utilize multiple endpoint detection systems, including flow cytometry (Ze5 and Cytek) and imaging platforms (ImageXpress Micro Confocal and HT.ai). Our imaging systems are integrated with incubators and plate manipulation devices to enable long-term live-cell imaging. Additionally, our automated plate readers are capable of conducting virtually any type of fluorescent or luminescent assay, such as FRET, TR-FRET, BRET, AlphaScreen, and luciferase-based assays.

Our capabilities are further enhanced by a microelectrode array (MEA) platform, which supports impedance measurements and other electrophysiological and physicochemical analyses. Together, our HTS Center provides a robust and flexible solution for a wide range of drug discovery applications, enabling high-quality data generation and insights into small molecule, peptide, and antibody therapeutics.
