# TAMU-3DRC: AI-Guided Academic Drug Discovery

![Design](/images/DESIGN.png)

At **TAMU-3DRC**, we specialize in modular, computation-first discovery strategies that bring together **artificial intelligence** and **deep domain expertise**. Our interdisciplinary team includes chemists, structural biologists, machine learning scientists, and informaticians who design flexible workflows for **probe and preclinical lead development**.

We support both hypothesis-driven and exploratory projects through a service model that emphasizes **academic-friendly integration** and **open-source science**.

---

## Strategic Project Planning

Our process starts with a **consultation and target evaluation**‚Äîassessing tractability, data readiness, and downstream feasibility. We are developing an intelligent, **multi-agent system** to assist in triaging projects, matching needs to the right technology stack and instrumentation, and aligning resources across the [GCC-iDDD](https://www.gulfcoastconsortia.org/home/research/chemical-genomics/) network.

---

## Guided AI, Not Just Automation

All AI and machine learning workflows are **informed by expert scientists** in the loop. From feature selection to score weighting, domain knowledge shapes how we build and deploy predictive models.

We use **[BIOVIA Pipeline Pilot](https://www.3ds.com/products/biovia)** to automate complex workflows‚Äîintegrating structure prediction, descriptor generation, virtual screening, and ML-SAR analysis into repeatable and auditable pipelines.

### üîç Tiered Virtual Screening

We screen libraries from **billions down to thousands** using a tiered approach:

1. **1B+ Compounds**  
   - [PharmacoNet](https://github.com/SeonghwanSeo/PharmacoNet) for pharmacophore-based prescreening  

2. **500M Compounds**  
   - [ADMET-AI](https://github.com/swansonk14/admet_ai): Predictive filtering for drug-like properties  
   - Expert filtering, diversity clustering

3. **‚â§1M Compounds**  
   - [GNINA](https://github.com/gnina/gnina): GPU-accelerated docking and scoring  
   - Selectivity and counter-screening

Post-screening steps include **re-expansion**, **Boltz2-based rescoring**, and **SAR optimization** by our medicinal chemistry team.
